Mr.Java
=======

Mr.Java: The Java IDE that's not quite an IDE, but not quite a CLI.

There has to be something that’s one step below a full blown, confusing, feature-ridden IDE, but one step above just using the command line. But what is it?

Enter Mr.Java

What exactly is Mr.Java?

Well, if you don’t wanna deal directly with the command line every time you want to compile or execute something, Mr.Java is your guy. He’ll compile for you, add Libraries to your class path, and run the whole thing — with three simple buttons. No B.S. No confusing window manipulation.

Want to add a library to your project? Drag it over Mr.Java, and he’ll put it in the right folder for you.

Want to add a java source file that you’ve written? Again, Drag it over Mr.Java and he’ll add it to the appropriate folder.

Once you’ve done all of that, compile your source files with just a click of a button — automatically including all of the Libraries you’ve added into the classpath. No more “No Class Found” errors.

And just as easily, click “Run” to get the program up and running, with the stdout written to a file cleverly named “stdout”, and the stderr cleverly written to file named — you guessed — stderr.
